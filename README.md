# Smart-Walker
This systematic study is about creating a smart walking walker, a supporting device for their day-to-day life needs. Some of the features of this smart walker include fall detection through accelerometer and gyroscopes, GPS and GSM for live tracking, sending and receiving messages in case of an emergency. 

As the global population ages, older adults face increasing
challenges with mobility and health. Many struggles with
reduced strength, balance issues, and chronic conditions,
which make moving around safely and independently more
difficult. This makes it essential to design products and
services that meet their specific needs and are easy for them
to use. Falls are a major concern for the elderly. According
to the World Health Organization, 28-35% of people aged
65 and above fall each year, and this rises to 32-42% for
those over 70. Falls often lead to serious injuries, loss of
independence, and even early death. [1] Devices like smart
walkers have become vital for many older adults, offering
support and reducing the risk of falls. Walking sticks and
smart walkers also help compensate for weak muscles, poor
vision, and environmental obstacles. This paper looks at
how smart walkers have developed and how they address
the challenges of aging. These devices not only help with
walking but also monitor movement in a simple, noninvasive
way. [2] However, there are still challenges, such
as high costs and limited accessibility, that make it difficult
for everyone to use them. The paper also explores ways to
improve these tools and make them more widely available.
By highlighting the benefits of smart walkers, this research
shows how they can improve the lives of older adults and
help create a society that supports aging with dignity and
independence. These tools are not just about mobilityâ€”they
also promote safety and freedom in everyday life. [1] [3]
